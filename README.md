# EngineeringNotebook_Eng3

This Tome of Knowledge is here to help my Engineering 3 kiddos do their best with writing an Engineering Notebook on GitHub.

## Template
Your readme should start off with a header or title, then a short description of what this repo is.

Then use a table of contents.  The name in the Parentheses must exactly match the name in the subheader, like this

## skateboard deck

### this is the deck i desinged following the instructions that were given

### Evidence

### the mass of my deck is 2.663 pounds, no because everthing is fully defined so the holes would not move.



## AssignmentName

### the trucks are .619 puonds, nothing really tripped me up it was cool to have different parts in one part studio.

This should create a repo that is structure similar to the thing you're reading right now.

## Exemplars

[This student did an awesome job with formatted snippets of his code, and really clear and well sized imaged](https://github.com/lmiller87/CircuitPython).  I didn't like the reflections or descriptions as much, too brief.

[His first few reflections were AMAZING.](https://github.com/vwellmo57/CircuitPython/blob/master/README.md) but the second half tapered off.  Just look at the first couple reflections.

## UsefulCircuitPythonStuff

My former Engineering 3 Kiddos wanted you to have this webpage, they found this site was crucial in helping them figure out how to switch their brains from Arduino to Circuit Python. So bookmark this site!
